# Prop Snap To Grid

This plugin provides an update allow users to snap props to grid. 

## Usage

To make the prop snap, you'll have to tap left ctrl while in build mode and having a prop equiped. The prop will then snap to the specified increment. The prop can still be moved afterwards but the tools cursor will show where the prop will snap to whilst the prop is in free placement. The increment may be modified in the plugin settings tab.
